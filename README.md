# Laebrari — Digital Library & Borrowing Platform

Laebrari is a digital library system for homes, schools and offices.
It allows users to build their own libraries, lend or sell books, borrow from other libraries, and subscribe to libraries they like.

The goal is to make personal and community libraries easier to manage — while encouraging sharing instead of hoarding.

## Why I Built This

Many people own books but they sit on shelves, forgotten.
Borrowing is informal, books get lost, people forget who has what, and small libraries struggle to stay organized.

Laebrari explores how a simple shared system could:

- organize personal & community collections

- make borrowing and lending traceable

- support library owners with subscriptions or book sales

- help people actually use the books they already have
